## How does Streamlit differ from Flask?
Streamlit is designed specifically for building interactive web apps with data science and machine learning capabilities. 
It allows for rapid prototyping and deployment of apps using Python scripts. Streamlit abstracts away many of the complexities of web development, focusing on ease of use and quick iteration. 
Flask, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose web framework for Python. It provides greater flexibility and control over the development process, making it suitable for a wider range of web applications beyond data visualization.


## When would you use Flask instead of Streamlit?
Flask might be preferred over Streamlit in scenarios where more customization and control over the web application are required. 
If the project involves complex routing, authentication, or integration with other web services, Flask's flexibility and extensibility make it a better choice. 
Additionally, if the project requires a traditional web development approach with HTML templates, JavaScript, and CSS, Flask would be more suitable.
